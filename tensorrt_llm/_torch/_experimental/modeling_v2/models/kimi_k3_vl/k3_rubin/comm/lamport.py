"""Pushed MNNVL all-reduce (``TRTLLM_K3_AR_PUSH``), private to the Kimi K3 Rubin package.

A producer kernel may store its BF16 output straight into the Lamport buffers of the MNNVL
all-reduce that follows it (the K3 low-M FP8 GEMM's push epilogue, ``kernels/k3_lamport_ar.py``).
:func:`lamport_push_target` hands the buffers to the producer and :func:`finish_lamport_push`
completes the all-reduce, bitwise like the C++ kernel the call replaces.

This is the push API of the Rubin agentic work (``distributed/ops.py``:
``LamportPushTarget``/``LamportResult``/``LamportPending`` and the ``AllReduce`` /
``MNNVLAllReduce`` methods ``lamport_push_target``, ``lamport_push_tensor`` and
``finish_lamport_push``). Main's ``AllReduce`` has none of it, and the package does not edit
shared files, so the methods are free functions here that take the ``AllReduce`` module:
``allreduce.lamport_push_target(...)`` on that branch is ``lamport_push_target(allreduce, ...)``.
They work on main's MNNVL workspace (same dict keys and the same 9-word ``buffer_flags`` layout).

Differences from the branch, all forced by main:

* The C++ one-/two-shot switch is ``distributed.ops._MNNVL_ONE_SHOT_THRESHOLD_BYTES``
  (``TLLM_MNNVL_ONESHOT_THRESHOLD_BYTES``, or its other name ``TRTLLM_MNNVL_AR_ONESHOT_MAX_BYTES``):
  the pushed call must reproduce the kernel main's ``MNNVLAllReduce`` would have run.
* The device view of a workspace is built on the first eager call (main's ``MNNVLAllReduce``
  constructor cannot be hooked); during CUDA graph capture a workspace without a view, or one
  that would have to grow, gives no target (the caller falls back to the plain all-reduce). The
  eager warm-up forward that precedes every capture builds it.

Pushing is on with the target's ``ar_push`` feature (``k3_rubin/features.py``), read at import.
